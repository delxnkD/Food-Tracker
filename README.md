FOOD EXPIRY TRACKER

--Overview--

  Food Expiry Tracker is a simple Flask web application that helps users keep track of expiry dates of the food items. Users can upload a receipt image, and the app extracts item names using OCR (Tesseract). Each item is given an estimated expiry date based on a small internal database.
  The app includes:
  - User registration & login
  - OCR‑based item extraction
  - Automatic expiry calculation
  - Dashboard with fridge & pantry sections
  - Edit & delete options
  - Alerts for items expiring soon

--Features--

  - Upload receipt images (JPG/PNG)
  - OCR text extraction using Tesseract
  - Automatic expiry date calculation
  - Categorization into fridge or pantry
  - User accounts with hashed passwords
  - Dashboard showing all items
  - Edit and delete functionality
  - Expiring‑soon warning banner

--Working--

  1. User uploads a receipt image
  2. Tesseract OCR extracts text
  3. The app parses item names and quantities
  4. Each item is matched with:
     A category (fruit, dairy, bakery, etc.)
     A default expiry duration
  5. Items are saved to a MySQL database
  6. Dashboard displays items sorted by expiry date
